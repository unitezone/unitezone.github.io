				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/158/8/d/free_your_mind_by_jakeee94-d3ib07o.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="236" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>These questions have no right or wrong answers.</strong><br />
How old would you be if you didn&#8217;t know how old you are?<br />
Which is worse, failing or never trying?<br />
If life is so short, why do we do so many things we don’t like and like so many things we don’t do?<br />
When it’s all said and done, will you have said more than you have done?<br />
What is the one thing you’d most like to change about the world?<br />
If happiness was the national currency, what kind of work would make you rich?<br />
Are you doing what you believe in, or are you settling for what you are doing?<br />
If the average human life span was 40 years, how would you live your life differently?<br />
To what degree have you actually controlled the course your life has taken?<br />
Are you more worried about doing things right, or doing the right things?<br />
You’re having lunch with three people you respect and admire. They all start criticizing a close friend of yours, not knowing she is your friend. The criticism is distasteful and unjustified. What do you do?<br />
If you could offer a newborn child only one piece of advice, what would it be?<br />
Would you break the law to save a loved one?<br />
Have you ever seen insanity where you later saw creativity?<br />
What’s something you know you do differently than most people?<br />
How come the things that make you happy don’t make everyone happy?<br />
What one thing have you not done that you really want to do? What’s holding you back?<br />
Are you holding onto something you need to let go of?<br />
If you had to move to a state or country besides the one you currently live in, where would you move and why?<br />
Do you push the elevator button more than once? Do you really believe it makes the elevator faster?<br />
Would you rather be a worried genius or a joyful simpleton?<br />
Why are you, you?<br />
Have you been the kind of friend you want as a friend?<br />
Which is worse, when a good friend moves away, or losing touch with a good friend who lives right near you?<br />
What are you most grateful for?<br />
Would you rather lose all of your old memories, or never be able to make new ones?<br />
Is is possible to know the truth without challenging it first?<br />
Has your greatest fear ever come true?<br />
Do you remember that time 5 years ago when you were extremely upset? Does it really matter now?<br />
What is your happiest childhood memory? What makes it so special?<br />
At what time in your recent past have you felt most passionate and alive?<br />
If not now, then when?<br />
If you haven’t achieved it yet, what do you have to lose?<br />
Have you ever been with someone, said nothing, and walked away feeling like you just had the best conversation ever?<br />
Why do religions that support love cause so many wars?<br />
Is it possible to know, without a doubt, what is good and what is evil?<br />
If you just won a million dollars, would you quit your job?<br />
Would you rather have less work to do, or more work you actually enjoy doing?<br />
Do you feel like you’ve lived this day a hundred times before?<br />
When was the last time you marched into the dark with only the soft glow of an idea you strongly believed in?<br />
If you knew that everyone you know was going to die tomorrow, who would you visit today?<br />
Would you be willing to reduce your life expectancy by 10 years to become extremely attractive or famous?<br />
What is the difference between being alive and truly living?<br />
When is it time to stop calculating risk and rewards, and just go ahead and do what you know is right?<br />
If we learn from our mistakes, why are we always so afraid to make a mistake?<br />
What would you do differently if you knew nobody would judge you?<br />
When was the last time you noticed the sound of your own breathing?<br />
What do you love? Have any of your recent actions openly expressed this love?<br />
In 5 years from now, will you remember what you did yesterday? What about the day before that? Or the day before that?<br />
Decisions are being made right now. The question is: Are you making them for yourself, or are you letting others make them for you?</p>
